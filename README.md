# CRM APP 🖋️ 📝 🧍 💻 ℹ️

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) where the user could add the information of their costumers like name, lastname, phone-number, business name, the project use the "JSON-SERVER dependency" which help us to create a server so all the information will be storage in a "data base" , so we can create an API fast and easily (this just for test)

In the rendered list there are the options:
-eliminar : this option delete all the information of the costumer from our data base
-editar : this option edit the costumer selected and upload the new information
